    description: "The cotton crop is hit by many pests but pink bollworm is a major pest of cotton, which not only causes reduction in yield but also affects the lint quality by causing yellow spots in its fibre. The economic loss it causes is heavier than the impact of other worms. Depending on the degree of infestation and weather conditions, it can cause about 20 – 30 % loss. It is a serious pest of cotton throughout the world. In 2001, Pakistan faced difficulty in exporting its lint in the international market and this problem has occurred many times.",

    description: "The measures taken to avoid the incidence of a disease, reduce the amount of source that initiates and spreads the disease in the plant population. Proper measures taken minimize the loss caused by the disease and have traditionally been called control measures. The principle of plant disease management have two approaches that are directed towards a single disease in the crop or planning for the overall health of the crop. The common practice is to manage a particular disease but taking care of overall health of the crop is more profitable. The management of crop health involves a plan in which all disease of any significant nature in the crop are taken into consideration. This approach, though difficult, is one of more practical value for the farmer because they are interested in increasing the productivity of the crop and therefore, prefers a plan that can provide a safe guard against all possible diseases occurring in the area. If the cost involved in control measures fails to uplift the economic gain, even if the disease incidence is reduced, no farmer is likely to accept the recommendations for plant disease management. Therefore, the cost benefit ratio is a very important consideration in the application of control measures.",

    description: "Organic fruits and vegetables are getting more popularity due to health concerns. Because organic foods are cultivated without use of pesticides, synthetic fertilizers and plant growth hormones. Food processing in organic form of agriculture is done without ionizing radiation and without using food additives. Addition of artificial things is bane now, only the packaging material or artificial fruits and vegetables made up of polyfoam, plastic, PVC, wax, papier-mache and terracotta for grace your showcase and dining table.",

    description: "Guava trees produce sweet smelling fruits with an edible rind, with a creamy white, yellow or pink flesh. When ripe, guavas release a sharp, musky odour that draws fruit flies. Fruit flies are among the world’s most serious pests of different horticultural crops due to their direct impact on economy. They are among the most destructive pests. They cause enormous threat to the production of fruits and vegetables throughout the tropical and sub-tropical areas and causes both quantitative and qualitative losses. Fruit flies lay their eggs inside the fruit and the maggots feed on the flesh. As a result fruits rot and infestation often spread quickly."

    description: "Sowing crop on time guarantees better yield than the late sowing, because late sowing of fails to complete its physiological processes and ultimately it remains under stress and thus fails to determine its full potential. Notable point is that only 20 per cent wheat crop is planted before November 15, that is the optimum planting time, and 80 % is planted late every year. That’s the reason of considerable decrease in yield because of delayed sowing i-e One per cent per day i.e. 10-15 kg per day per hectare. Normally in cotton belts (44.9 per cent) delayed planting of wheat takes place and in rice track (21.3 per cent) that can be overcome by turbo-seeder , zero-tillage drill, early sowing varieties of cotton, late sowing varieties of wheat , using less time for land preparation and sowing of wheat in standing sticks of cotton crop. So, these practices allow farmers to save time, but still there are constraints which decrease yield of crop."

    description: "During early infection distortion is caused, due to which growth under the lesion stops while the surrounding tissue develops normally. Mature fruit during late infections appear as dark, roughly-circular spots and at the centers of large lesions appears as dry, corky and a greyish, along the border of the lesion raised cuticle may be evident. While the corky areas may crack, thus allowing entry of fruit-rotting. Thus in case of storage lesions may continue to develop from symptomless infections present before harvest."
